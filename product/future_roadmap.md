# Listy Gifty: Path to $1M in 2026

## The Math Problem

At $25 CAD/year, you need **40,000 paying users** to hit $1M. That's extremely hard for a consumer app. Here's how to change the equation:

| Strategy | Price Point | Users Needed | Difficulty |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Current model | $25/yr | 40,000 | Very Hard |
| Premium tiers | $50-100/yr | 10,000-20,000 | Hard |
| Affiliate revenue | 5-8% commission | $12-20M in purchases | Medium |
| B2B/Corporate | $500-5000/yr | 200-2,000 | Medium |
| **Blended approach** | All of above | Mix | **Best path** |

## Revenue Model Summary for $1M

| Source | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Premium subscriptions (10k users x $35 avg) | $350k | $500k |
| Pro tier (3k users x $60) | $180k | $250k |
| Affiliate commissions (5% on $3M purchases) | $150k | $300k |
| Corporate/B2B (100 companies x $500 avg) | $50k | $150k |
| Wedding registries (500 x $75 + commission) | $50k | $100k |
| **Total** | **$780k** | **$1.3M** |

The key is **affiliate revenue + tiered pricing + B2B**. Consumer subscriptions alone won't get you there.
